    "Proposal 1: The Influence of Online Social Interactions on Overall Well-Being\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Question: Do online social interactions positively affect individuals’ overall well-being? \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "Independent variable—frequency of online interactions (for example: the number of video calls or social media interactions per week). A histogram will express the shape of the frequency of online interactions. This would provide insight into whether most people have low or high online interactions, showing the variation of the data that may carry meaningful analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent variable—Overall well-being score, based on mental, emotional, and physical health indicators on self-reported survey data. A box plot of well-being scores will aid in viewing dispersion and central tendency of well-being across various categories of frequency of interaction. This will outline any potential outliers and enable viewing range and median levels of well-being across the different interaction groups. \n",

    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: Conduct simple linear regression to examine the relationship between online interaction frequency and well-being scores. \n",

    "Assumptions: The relationship is linear, data points are independent, and residuals are normally distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis and Expected Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the frequency of online interactions and overall well-being (slope = 0). \n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion: If the results show a significant positive slope, then it implies that increased online interaction frequency is associated with higher well-being. "

    "\n",
    "Independent Variable: Strength of social support network (for example: number of close friends or supportive family members). A bar chart displaying the number of individuals within each level of social support can show the distribution across these categories.
